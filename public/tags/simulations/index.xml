      <description>The model performance measure \(R^2\) is often subject to fierce criticism for being prone to its context. This notebook describes some well known criticism of \(R^2\) and tests the deficiencies by simulations. By combining theory, code and accessible graphics I want to show the implications for getting any useful information from \(R^2\).
Literature The theoretical considerations are partly taken from
 The Elements of Statistical Learning p.14-16 Urban and Mayerl (2011) set up a poison list of 10 items to be considered, as \(R^2\) is artificially biased by other parameters.</description>
